# ==== Set up load paths
#

# Add the app's "gems" directory to the gem load path.
# Note that the gems directory must mirror the structure RubyGems uses for
# directories under which gems are kept.
#
# To conveniently set it up, use gem install -i <merb_app_root/gems>
# when installing gems. This will set up the structure under /gems
# automagically.
#
# An example:
#
# You want to bundle ActiveRecord and ActiveSupport with your Merb
# application to be deployment environment independent. To do so,
# install gems into merb_app_root/gems directory like this:
#
# gem install -i merb_app_root/gems activesupport-post-2.0.2.gem activerecord-post-2.0.2.gem
#
# Since RubyGems will search merb_app_root/gems for dependencies, order
# in the statement above is important: we need to install ActiveSupport which
# ActiveRecord depends on first.
#
# Remember that bundling of dependencies as gems with your application
# makes it independent of the environment it runs in and is a very
# good, encouraged practice to follow.

# If you want modules and classes from libraries organized like
# merbapp/lib/magicwand/lib/magicwand.rb to autoload,
# uncomment this.
# Merb.push_path(:lib, Merb.root / "lib") # uses **/*.rb as path glob.



require 'config/dependencies.rb'
 
use_orm :datamapper
use_test :rspec
use_template_engine :haml

Merb::Config.use do |c|
  c[:use_mutex] = false
  c[:session_store] = 'cookie'  # can also be 'memory', 'memcache', 'container', 'datamapper
  
  # cookie session store configuration
  c[:session_secret_key]  = '8bbdb729b6ccb866696b363f5eb421325be8ff03'  # required for cookie session store
  c[:session_id_key] = '_keypressr_session_id' # cookie session id key, defaults to "_session_id"
end
 
Merb::BootLoader.before_app_loads do
  # This will get executed after dependencies have been loaded but before your app's classes have loaded.
end
 
Merb::BootLoader.after_app_loads do
  # This will get executed after your app's classes have been loaded.
