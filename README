Keypressr is a web app for improving typing speed and accuracy for programmers.

Check it out at http://www.keypressr.com (adding the omitted 'e' also works).

I'd love to hear about any bugs you spot or features you'd like to see, along 
with the languages that you'd like to see more of and/or example code you'd
like to have as one of the random examples.  I'm particularly interested in how
developers would prefer to see language designations when frameworks (Rails or 
Merb in my case) are involved.

Please give me some feedback at: trptcolin AT gmail DOT [you know this part] or
message me on GitHub (trptcolin).
